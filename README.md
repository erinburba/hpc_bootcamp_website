# Energy Justice Chatbot Comparison

Compare the responses from two chatbots trained on different energy justice data sets.

The chatbots utilize [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [Paper QA](https://github.com/whitead/paper-qa).

All credit for the chatbots goes to the amazing work of Groups A and B at the [2023 Intro to HPC Bootcamp](https://shinstitute.org/energy-justice-bootcamp-2023/)!

Group A: Alexis, Ciel, Kaylan, Paul, Rene; Peer Mentor Erin

Group B: Carolina, Esra, Maarten, Samira, Zaire; Peer Mentor Jordan
